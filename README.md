## The Journey So Far

Started building websites that worked. Then websites that *worked well*. Now building systems that don't just function—they adapt, scale, and survive production.

My path wasn't linear. It started with curiosity around **how things break**, which naturally led to obsession over **how to make them unbreakable**. Early projects were full of over-engineering and naive optimism. Recent ones show restraint, architectural thinking, and an understanding that the best code is often the code you *don't* write.

I'm drawn to problems where **performance meets complexity**—where caching strategies matter, where database design influences user experience, where choosing between REST and GraphQL has tangible business impact.

Currently exploring: **distributed systems**, **event-driven architectures**, and **developer tooling that doesn't get in the way**.

---

## What I Build

### **Web Applications That Don't Feel Like Web Applications**

Real-time dashboards, e-commerce platforms, and admin tools where **latency is measured in milliseconds** and user experience isn't negotiable. Built with modern frameworks but designed with fundamentals: clean separation of concerns, stateless where possible, stateful where necessary.

### **APIs That Developers Actually Want to Use**

RESTful services with predictable responses, comprehensive error handling, and documentation that doesn't require archaeology. GraphQL endpoints when flexibility matters. WebSocket connections when HTTP isn't fast enough.

### **Tools That Solve My Own Problems First**

Automation scripts, CLI utilities, and developer productivity enhancers born from personal frustration. If it saves me 10 minutes a day, I build it. If it saves the team an hour a week, I polish it.

## Featured Work

### **[Repository Name 1]** — *Architecture that scales with complexity*
Full-stack application demonstrating clean separation between data, business logic, and presentation. Built with performance as a feature, not an afterthought.

**Impact**: Handled 10K+ concurrent users | Sub-200ms response times | Zero downtime deployments

---

### **[Repository Name 2]** — *Developer experience as product*
Internal tooling that reduced deployment friction by 60%. CLI-first design with intelligent defaults and escape hatches for edge cases.

**Impact**: 4-hour deployment cycles → 20 minutes | Reduced rollback incidents by 80%

---

### **[Repository Name 3]** — *Real-time without the chaos*
Event-driven system using WebSockets and message queues. Designed for eventual consistency with graceful degradation under load.

**Impact**: 1M+ events processed daily | 99.9% uptime | Self-healing architecture

---

## Engineering Principles (Inferred From Code)

✦ **Simple beats clever** — Readable code survives longer than smart code  
✦ **Performance is a feature** — Users feel milliseconds, not benchmarks  
✦ **Fail explicitly, recover gracefully** — Error messages should guide, not confuse  
✦ **Test what breaks, not what works** — Edge cases reveal system understanding  
✦ **Document decisions, not syntax** — Why matters more than what  
✦ **Ship incrementally** — Perfect is the enemy of shipped

## You Should Work With Me If...

You're building something that **matters beyond the sprint cycle**. Your team values **ownership over handoffs**, **iteration over perfection**, and **impact over activity**.

You need someone who:
- **Thinks in systems**, not just features
- **Debugs with hypotheses**, not guesses
- **Writes code others can maintain** at 2 AM during incidents
- **Questions requirements** when they don't serve users
- **Ships regularly** without sacrificing quality

Ideal for: **Startups scaling past MVP** | **Product teams with technical debt** | **Distributed teams building complex systems**
